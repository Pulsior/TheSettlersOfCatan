TheSettlersOfCatan
==================

The Settlers of Catan in Minecraft! (Heavy WIP!)

This plugin will be able to do everything a board Catan game can do.

Implemented features:
  - Color system. Every player chooses a color and his structures and roads will be of the chosen color.
  - Ability to buy settlements, cities and roads with raw resources using a command.
  - Victory point system, including a scoreboard.
  - Colored wool in settlements and cities.
  - Turn system.
  - Dice system.
  - Automatically give appropriate resources to players.
  - Ability to save the game and continue when the server has been restarted.

Planned features:
  - Ability to buy development cards.
  - Add the robber, deprieving players of resources.
  - Coastal trade.
  - Permissions.

Please note:
  - I don't have a Pulsior.com domain, but I used a com.Pulsior package structure
    since it's conventional.
  - This plugin is designed for use with a specific map. When using it with another Settlers of Catan map, the
  automatic resource functions will not work.
